which is on offer in scotland and wales  saying it was  unsustainable .  david rogers  from the local government association  said agencies were working together on the kind of innovation proposed by the government. and tony hunter  president of the association of directors of social services  said the plans could improve dignity and well-being for thousands of people. but age concern argued social care was chronically under-funded and older people were being offered choice in principle  but not in practice. its director general  gordon lishman  said:  direct payments will not work if there are no services for people to choose from locally.   the tories say people who pay for three years  long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives. tory spokesman simon burns said more than 80 000 long term care places had been lost since 1997.  after eight years of persistent change  dogmatic enforcement of regulation  and overbearing government initiatives - we need action  not a vision   said mr burns. the lib dems say they would fund free personal care by a new 50% tax rate on incomes over \\u00a3100 000. health spokesman paul burstow said:  promoting independence sounds good and helping people to live in their own homes is a goal we share.  but the risk is that independence can turn into isolation if the right support and care is not available.\",\n          \"beer giant swallows russian firm brewing giant inbev has agreed to buy alfa-eco s stake in sun interbrew  russia s second-largest brewer  for up to 259.7m euros ($353.3m; \\u00a3183.75m).  alfa-eco  the venture capital arm of russian conglomerate alfa group  has a one-fifth stake in sun interbrew. the deal gives inbev  the world s biggest beermaker  near-total control over the russian brewer. inbev bought out another partner in august 2004. inbev brands include bass  stella artois  hoegaarden and staropramen. it employs 77 000 people  running operations in over 30 countries across the americas  europe and asia pacific.  the leuven-based brewery said it would own 97.3% of the voting shares and 98.8% of the non-voting shares of sun interbrew. the deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2005. inbev was formed in august 2004 when belgium s interbrew bought brazilian brewer ambev. sun interbrew  which employs 8 000 staff  owns breweries in eight russian cities - klin  ivanovo  saransk  kursk  volzhsky  omsk  perm and novocheboksarsk. there are also three breweries in ukraine  in the cities of chernigov  nikolaev and kharkov.\",\n          \"athens memories soar above lows well  it s goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens.  obviously  there s no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe. but i want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember - or forget - for athletics.      one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly s success in the 800m.  winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality. kelly had been full of  should i  shouldn t i   thoughts about going for the double in athens. i thought why wouldn t you do the 800m  it s your best event  it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story.      the victory for the british men s 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games. i think the four of them - jason gardener  darren campbell  marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis - knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal. the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake.      hicham el guerrouj s olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kelly s on a global scale.  he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5 000m titles. as soon as he had added the 5 000m crown and i had finished commentating  i jumped up  ran down the stairs  pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories. hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with  even though my french and his english are not very good.      what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood. dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10 000m five days later was not wise. that was her heart and not her head reacting. paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.  things like niggling injuries  not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her. i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained. and if even the smallest thing doesn t feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon  10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. the positive thing to take from paula s olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people - including me.      purely as a race  paula s victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. it was so nip-and-tuck between her and kenya s susan chepkemei and you don t usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because  to use one of my favourite words  paula showed real  bouncebackability . and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out.      kelly and the 4x100m boys  victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team. we should be concerned that we re not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level.  the only individual men s finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m. i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed  and that s where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy. dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb. the thing is if we don t have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn t look good for the beijing olympics and beyond.      i tell you what i really enjoyed this year  benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march. in the absence of paula  we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve. so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special.      to be honest  i m getting bored with all the drug scandals  especially balco. i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on.  having said that  i m always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore. and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou  well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while. the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "('parmalat boasts doubled profits parmalat the italian food group at the centre of one of europe s most painful corporate scandals has reported a doubling in profit . its pre-tax earnings in the fourth quarter were 77m euros ( £53m ; $ 100m ) up from 38m in the same period of 2003. less welcome was the news that the firm had been fined 11m euros for having violated takeover rules five years ago . the firm sought bankruptcy protection in december 2003 after disclosing a 4bn-euro hole in its accounts . overall the company s debt is close to 12bn euros and is falling only slowly . its brands well-known in italy and overseas have continued to perform strongly however and have barely lost revenue since the scandal broke . but a crucial factor for the company s future is the legal unwinding of its intensely complex financial position . on tuesday the company s administrator turnaround expert enrico bondi sued morgan stanley its former banker to return 136m euros relating to a 2003 bond deal . that brought to 49 the number of banks that mr bondi has sued a mass of legal action that could bring in as much as 3bn euros . the company has also sued former auditors and financial advisors for damages . and criminal cases against the company s former management are proceeding separately .', 'france starts digital terrestrial france has become the last big european country to launch a digital terrestrial tv ( dtt ) service . initially more than a third of the population will be able to receive 14 free-to-air channels . despite the long wait for a french dtt roll-out the new platform s backers hope to emulate the success of its uk free-to-air counterpart freeview . recent figures from the uk s regulator ofcom showed freeview was more popular than the sky digital satellite service . in the three months to september 2004 almost five times as many people signed up to the uk s free-to-air dtt service compared with sky . almost 60 % of uk households have gone digital on at least one television set through cable satellite or freeview . the french dtt platform is known as tnt which stands for tv numerique terrestre or digital terrestrial television . but it is being branded as television numerique pour tous or digital television for all . tnt is a joint venture between public broadcaster france televisions and a handful of cable and satellite operators . digital terrestrial tv will launch as a free-to-air platform to start with adding pay-tv channels later . thirty-five contenders have bid for an additional eight frequencies on top of the 14 already allocated . a couple of years ago dtt had a bad image said olivier gerolami chief operating officer of tnt . but everyone s impressed with dtt in the uk italy and germany and they realise it is a very good idea . france is the poorest market in europe in terms of free-to-air national channels so it has the potential to be one of the biggest dtt markets mr gerolami added in remarks quoted by the us entertainment industry paper variety . tnt aims to reach 35 % of france s population at launch from 17 transmission sites . the transmission area will initially include paris lille lyon and toulouse . eventually there will be 115 sites reaching over 80 % of homes . digital terrestrial set-top boxes are available from as little as 70 euros ( £50 ) . a recent survey by mediametrie found that 70 % of people interviewed were aware of dtt and 25 % were planning to buy a digital receiver . consumer electronics companies such as nokia sagem sony and thomson are gearing up for production . the conseil superieur de l audiovisuel ( csa ) the french broadcasting regulator said : following the recent success of freeview in the uk some manufacturers are optimistic about sales prospects . media analysts believe that initially the majority of viewers will buy inexpensive set-top boxes that are unable to support interactive services . the csa said the current aim of reaching 85 % of the population by 2007 was achievable but the future of the remaining tv viewers required action by the public sector . for the most part they are people living in mountainous or border areas which will remain beyond the reach of digital terrestrial tv for years . up to 15 pay-tv channels will launch on dtt between september 2005 and march 2006. leading pay-tv operators canal plus and tps have submitted bids to market bouquets of channels . free-to-air services will be broadcast in mpeg-2 format . but pay-tv operators will be allowed to broadcast in mpeg-4 - a much better compression technology - which will potentially allow for high-definition ( hd ) subscription services in the future . tnt expects between 700 000 and one million dtt set-top boxes to be sold in 2005. it is difficult to tell how quickly it will take off said mr gerolami but we re optimistic that it will revolutionise television in france . other analysts were less optimistic predicting consumers would now be less likely to sign up for pay-tv subscriptions . we think free dtt could put brakes on the underlying growth of pay-tv in france said henri de bodinat vice-president of the arthur d. little consultancy .', 'gallery unveils interactive tree a christmas tree that can receive text messages has been unveiled at london s tate britain art gallery . the spruce has an antenna which can receive bluetooth texts sent by visitors to the tate . the messages will be unwrapped by sculptor richard wentworth who is responsible for decorating the tree with broken plates and light bulbs . it is the 17th year that the gallery has invited an artist to dress their christmas tree . artists who have decorated the tate tree in previous years include tracey emin in 2002. the plain green norway spruce is displayed in the gallery s foyer . its light bulb adornments are dimmed ordinary domestic ones joined together with string . the plates decorating the branches will be auctioned off for the children s charity artworks . wentworth worked as an assistant to sculptor henry moore in the late 1960s . his reputation as a sculptor grew in the 1980s while he has been one of the most influential teachers during the last two decades . wentworth is also known for his photography of mundane everyday subjects such as a cigarette packet jammed under the wonky leg of a table .', 'blair says uk tsunami aid to soar tony blair has predicted the british government will eventually give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid to countries hit by the tsunami . the prime minister was speaking publicly for the first time since returning from his holiday in egypt . mr blair insisted he had been intimately involved in all decisions at all times despite being abroad . he was speaking before the uk joins a three-minute silence at noon across the eu for the estimated 150 000 dead . the foreign office says 41 britons are now confirmed to have died in the tsunami which struck south asia on boxing day with 158 others missing . asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday mr blair told bbc radio 4 s today programme : i don t think this is a situation in which the british people need me to articulate what they feel . i think they feel - as we all do - shock horror and absolute solidarity with those people who have lost their lives . the important thing was action and not words he said adding that of the £50m given by the government so far only six or seven million had been spent . it would become easier in the coming weeks to assess just how much money would have to be put in . my estimate is we will need to spend from government several hundred million pounds . so we will far and away more than match the generosity of the british people he said . asked whether he had not returned to work immediately because he was under doctors orders to rest mr blair said there was also a story he had been away for plastic surgery . as you can see unfortunately i am still looking the same as i always did he joked . the prime minister took personal charge of the uk s response on tuesday chairing a meeting of the emergency committee of ministers that has convened daily since boxing day . he also spoke on the telephone to us president george bush and the presidents of sri lanka and indonesia . chancellor gordon brown earlier backed a plan to freeze the foreign debts of all the affected nations . mr brown who was not at the downing street meeting says he has been in intensive talks with other g8 finance ministers . germany proposed a freeze last week and canada has begun its own moratorium . the chancellor said the plan would initially save the most affected countries about $ 3bn ( £1.58bn ) in repayments . tory leader michael howard also backed the proposals but said ministers had been playing catch-up with public donations . foreign secretary jack straw is to visit thailand and indonesia this week . during his trip mr straw will represent the g8 at the international conference called in jakarta indonesia on thursday . on friday he will visit the thai beach resort of phuket where british families are still searching for relatives . international development secretary hilary benn will also visit aceh in indonesia as well as sri lanka . the british public has now pledged £76m in aid with emergency supplies from the british government starting to arrive in the region on three raf flights in a joint operation with scandinavian countries . two ships - the royal fleet auxiliary ship diligence and frigate hms chatham - have arrived in the disaster area . a second royal fleet auxiliary vessel the bayleaf is also being sent . uk charities have also begun chartering planes to deliver aid . - a bbc news special : asia remembered including the three-minutes silence will be shown on bbc one and bbc news 24 from 1130 to 1215 gmt on wednesday .', 'uk directors guild nominees named martin scorsese and clint eastwood are among the nominees for the top prize at the

award for his work in film and theatre while theatre director simon mcburney will be given an award for outstanding directorial achievement .', 'lasting influence of legend charles ray charles who has won a string of posthumous grammy awards belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music . his sound encompassed so many styles - blues gospel jazz rock n roll even country - and had a real impact on the nascent uk beat and r & b scenes . compared in stature to elvis presley by some commentators charles songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as joe cocker steve winwood eric burdon and van morrison . his influence has extended to contemporary artists such as norah jones with whom he recently recorded a duet . if james brown was the godfather of soul then ray charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers . along with sam cooke he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south baptist church with the devil s music of r & b to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists . without charles it is hard to imagine the tear-stained atlantic r & b sound of aretha franklin otis redding or wilson pickett . he was also a talented jazz composer arranger and band leader playing at the newport jazz festival and carnegie hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as milt jackson and david fathead newman . unfortunately he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction which led to him being arrested in 1965. his string of 1950s atlantic r & b successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock n roll greats including i ve got a woman ( roy orbison elvis presley ) and hallelujah i love her so ( eddie cochran ) . after the exuberance of his 1959 signature song what d i say charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style recording hoagy carmichael s sentimental string ballad georgia on my mind and the upbeat hit the road jack . he also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of hank williams standards such as your cheating heart and you win again . more than 40 years after its release his 1962 abc album modern sounds in country and western music is still regarded as a classic . his version of don gibson s i can t stop loving you topped the pop and r & b charts in the us . in 1972 he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album a message from the people . on it he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as stevie wonder james brown curtis mayfield and marvin gaye . more than 20 years later he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album my world which featured hip-hop beats - although charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was . among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when charles died aged 73 in june 2004 was one from his friend the producer quincy jones who described him as a brother in every sense of the word . there will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as ray charles did he said . former manfred mann singer paul jones who sang on 1960s hits such as come tomorrow and sha la la said charles was one of his heroes . i m quite sure my own writing was influenced by him he told bbc news online . i would put money on the proposition that ray charles will have an influence on music forever .', 'sport betting rules in spotlight a group of mps and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport . the parliamentary group on betting and gaming held a substantial inquiry into betting last year . it followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport such as that done using the internet and mobile phones has led to more cheating . the all-party group recommended 15 ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting . they include a proposal for raising the maximum jail sentence for gambling cheats above the current two years . lord condon head of the international cricket council s anti-corruption unit who originally made the call for longer prison sentences said the two-year penalty was derisory . you could get a bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports . symbolically a higher penalty perhaps as the bill passes through the two houses might be appropriate . the report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters and for bookmakers to set up audit trails - something the new betting exchanges already do - to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced . lord faulkner of worcester who chaired the inquiry said : whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges - because of the facility they provide to bet against a result - has increased the potential for corruption . it is important that the government works with sporting administrators to review the difficulties faced by governing bodies in convicting the guilty and penalising them appropriately . the panel s aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right . as well as the growth of internet and mobile phone betting there has been the creation of betting exchanges which allow punters to fix odds between themselves . betting exchanges allow punters to back ( to win ) but also lay ( to lose ) a horse . this means they can control their odds at winning by placing their money both ways .', 'uk pledges £1bn to vaccine effort uk chancellor gordon brown has offered £960m ( $ 1.8bn ) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes . in a speech he called for action to reach the 2000 millennium declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates . mr brown has just returned from a tour of african nations . the £1bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief trade aid education and health . the chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the uk s department for international development and the un development programme on wednesday . mr brown welcomed news that the bill gates foundation and norway are joining up to put an extra £0.53bn ( $ 1bn ) into the global alliance for vaccines and immunisation ( gavi ) . britain france gavi and the gates foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the international finance facility ( iff ) to the area of immunisation . that could see donors making long-term legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets . as well as pledging £960m over 15 years to the immunisation iff britain urged other donors to contribute . if gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £4bn ( $ 7.4bn ) over 10 years then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter mr brown argued . campaign groups including friends of the earth the world development movement and war on want said uk government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty . war on want s john hilary said : compassionate rhetoric can not disguise the reality of the government s neo-liberal policies . as long as mr blair and mr brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty not lifted out of it .', 'kenyon denies robben barca return chelsea chief executive peter kenyon has played down reports that arjen robben will return for the champions league match against barcelona . he s been

doubles players he said . they have everything calculated and we had very little to do . i was a bit surprised that i was named to play the doubles match because i hardly play doubles . arrese said :

if there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election . and it was largely that fear that led to tony blair and gordon brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary labour party . the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely-held view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election . as one hugely-disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting : it is time they realised it s not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt . it is a sentiment that is now running throughout the labour benches with mps eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand . as paul flynn said : what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times when we wanted to come together we wanted to lead on the global issues to change politics for the next decade the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party two people we greatly respect . stephen pound echoed the message saying : we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve not for the labour party but for this country is the appearance of division . we remember the 1980s . they backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be named and shamed . the dressing down appears to have done the trick with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn - who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr brown s stead - and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch . but the effect of all this is to have achieved two things . firstly nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors . even mr prescott admitted that had he still been a backbencher he would have been giving mr blair and mr brown the same message . secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has to all intents and purposes kicked off . but whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good - or can even be sustained through the campaign - remains to be seen . even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that while mr brown is in africa for a week the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term . and he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be new labour through and through . similarly some were pointing out that the chancellor during the election poster launch once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said . none the less what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the brown camp effectively strengthening the prime minister s hand . for example will those brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime minister s timing or subject matter as may have been the case in the past what all seem agreed on however is that this sniping simply can not be allowed to go on through the election campaign . mind you we have heard similar pledges before .', 'no uk premiere for rings musical the producers behind

top 10. the other five brits winners were already established before sound of 2004 was compiled . the ceremony will be televised on itv1 on thursday . i m speechless . best song of the last 25 years yeah right . i very much doubt that angels was even the best song of the week that it came out . like every track robbie has released as a single it s a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before . give us a break ... ! ! ! best song in 25 years you must be joking . its good if you like that sort of thing but really ! listened to angels on radio 1 this morning when i was driving into work . had not heard it for a while . i love robs voice the lyrics and tune . perfection ! as usual the public have short memories when it comes to voting for the greatest . there must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more . it s not exactly groundbreaking . presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low ... i m actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years ! ! what about the specials - ghost town the buzzcocks - ever fallen in love with someone ... happy mondays - kinky afro mcalmont & butler - yes joy division - love will tear us apart ... angels is middle-of-the-road rubbish . angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap . it s musically and lyrically inept ; and fantastically overrated a bit like mr williams himself . this result isn t very surprising though the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music ! best of the last 25 years maybe . cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really . not much competition in the last 25 years after all . it s alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years .... it s a travesty . rubbish ! who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio 2 but i don t recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn t know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last 25 years . how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop was on the way out - where on earth did this dreadful list appear from while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty . then again well done robbie good show . you ve got to be kidding . angels is a great song but not the best song of the last 25 years . only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits . i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don t think its the best song from the past 25 years ! right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn t that good ! i m happy for robbie himself though ! best song in the last 25 years what a joke ! think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels . phil collins doesn t deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote angels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it . soppy rubbish at best . hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards . so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me it s proof that music and democracy just don t mix . still at least it wasn t will young ... oh it s all just a bit of fun . people take these awards too seriously ! robbie has millions of loyal fans while even non-fans know the words to angels . him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards . personally i wanted will young to win but that was not really due to his musical talent ! i hate the song all it brings back is memories of school discos and no-one to slow-dance with ! i agree about angels . i never get fed up hearing it . whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along ( very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out ) . the song makes me calm and serene and happy . well done robbie . i think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angels isn t really that good a song . it certainly isn t anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush . angels is a fantastic song . all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers . it s a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups . robbie did in no way deserve that mantle . whenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best ... we forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example . they weren t cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think . yes angels is the best song since the past 25 years because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning . i ve always disliked angels intensely . i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre-teens teens and middle aged women to accept low quality/ low aspirational music as classic songwriting . it s orrible . it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who don t particularly like music all that much . folks without collections ; folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music . angels adds nothing - it is merely an irritating distraction - a wasp that refuses to go away on a summer s afternoon picnic . what a dreadful result . if you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don t you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote . booo hisss angels best song you are kidding right last five years i might be willing to accept but 25 no way . did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say 1995 really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century . no surprise about robbie williams considering the list . where on earth did the nominations list come from compiled by an eleven year-old girl perhaps i mean will young come on . what a load of crap best song in the last 25 years - i don t think so ! ! what about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless but robbie williams doesn t even come close . what a joke . that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angels where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radio s off . why a half-baked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops ( think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example and by whom ) should be voted the best song of the past 25 years is beyond me . if this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give up . why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last 25 years ! ! ! ! i think not i didn t realize radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10 ! ! people have such short memories ! a great song yes but the best of the last 25 years not a chance . i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here . the great british public at work again . it s a mediocre sentimental and safe song . granted it s not too bad either . but can it stand up against anything by the smiths ( in particular how soon is now ) or anything from the stone roses first album nope . no because i m not female and i m not 10 ! ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song . but it is no way the best song of the past 25 years ! the shortlist wasn t great but him winning it is a joke ! predictable and laughable . the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 years . the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed . whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie s repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years . i am a huge robbie fan and love that song . but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the list . have radio 2 listeners even heard of joy division a band who through two albums have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last 25 years than robbie williams ever will . no doubt about it . there s not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling . some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song . it should have been joy division.those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song . i sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have done for music today . yes ! ! i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people . there were other great songs in the category ... but somebody had to win ! robbie was a deserved winner . i am astounded that such a second-rate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs ! it s a terrible song voted for by the masses who don t have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music . the best song of the past 25 years really come on this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie down ... it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division . i suppose it s confirmed one thing - the british public are consistently dull : - & lt ; ( no offence robbie but pleeease ! there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids . no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffin ! i think robbie deserves it he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide . anybody who says he doesn t deserve it is jealous of his success . the only real challenger was queen but hey another one bites the dust ! ! obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it . if this is the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry is in trouble . sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best record . a sad day for music it s not the type of music i normally like but even as a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people . that s why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years . it s a good all-rounder . just like robbie . best song in 25 years since 1980 i m confused . angels isn t a bad song . it s a nice catchy formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes . but this is not great music . if anything it s regressive . bland even . i suppose it s just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become . granted angels is a good song however it really wasn t up against any other proper competition . the queen s song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic ! also why weren t the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angels ... i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn t getting more awards so they had to make one up for him ! best song of the last 25 years what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner . sigh . on the upside at least it wasn t bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankful . angels is without doubt a great song but i really don t think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song ! ! ! don t get me wrong i m not disputing his looks but there are more deserved winners . it would have been a travesty had angels not won . without angels robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists . it has to be seen performed live with 125 000 people singing along to be fully appreciated . well done rob . i find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past 25 years ! i m rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning . what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp ... not only making fantastic songs but also making changes doing something different . why must best always come down to most commercially popular i ve nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales . the same goes with the scissor sisters i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album comes no where near u2 s new record neither are they in the same league . once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reasons but for profit . no surprise really it s voted for by the general public . since when did they have taste in music personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard ! it absolutely deserved to win . it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come . it s an absolute joke however most of the original 25 were very poor choices as well . all in all a pretty pointless exercise ! the song is overplayed and oversentimental . out of the rather poor five choices that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen . i suppose we should be thankful that it didn t end up in the hands of will young though . although it has nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win . everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody nothing compares 2 u etc . much better songs and more timeless . give it to someone with real talent . although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years . this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye . why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that s all it means !', 'sluggish economy hits german jobs the number of people out of work in europe s largest economy has risen for the tenth straight month as growth remains stubbornly slow . german unemployment rose 7 000 in november to 4.464 million people or 10.8 % of the workforce . the seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller rise than expected as government measures to encourage job creation began to take effect . but officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market . there are clear signs of a revival in domestic demand said frank-juergen weise head of the federal labour agency in a statement . but growth of 0.1 % ... in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market . high oil prices and the soaring euro - which damages the competitiveness of exporters - were also having a negative effect he said . the brunt of the unemployment is still being felt in the eastern part of germany where the rate is 18.8 % . with unemployment stuck above 4 million for years the government of chancellor gerhard schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda . a controversial package of measures to shake up incentives to get back to work paid for by cutting some cherished benefits has sparked anger among some german workers . strikes in a number of industries notably among the country s iconic carmakers have demonstrated the displeasure - as well as fears about further job losses as outsourcing takes hold . among the new initiatives are the so-called one-euro jobs which top up unemployment benefit . the scheme s formal launch is january but hirings for these

slide and has tumbled to a new low against the euro . investors are betting that the european central bank ( ecb ) will not do anything to weaken the euro while the us is thought to favour a declining dollar . the us is struggling with a ballooning trade deficit and analysts said one of the easiest ways to fund it was by allowing a depreciation of the dollar . they have predicted that the dollar is likely to fall even further . the us currency was trading at $ 1.364 per euro at 1800 gmt on monday . this compares with $ 1.354 to the euro in late trading in new york on friday which was then a record low . the dollar has weakened sharply since september when it traded about $ 1.20 against the euro . it has lost 7 % this year while against the japanese yen it is down 3.2 % . traders said that thin trading levels had amplified monday s move . it s not going to take much to push [ the dollar ] one way or the other said grant wilson of mellon bank . liquidity - a measure of the number of

issue arguing it is a matter for individual conscience . the prime minister s spokesman set out mr blair s view after the top catholic in england and wales backed michael howard s stance on abortions . the tory leader supports a reduction in the legal limit from 24 weeks to 20 and has said current rules are tantamount to abortion on demand . the prime minister has made it clear he has no plans to the change the law . mr blair s spokesman said : the catholic church has a well-known position on this issue and it was one of many issues the cardinal mentioned and therefore it should be seen in that context . his words came as cardinal cormac murphy o connor the archbishop of westminster backed mr howard s stance and distanced himself from labour . in a statement he said abortion was a very key issue saying : the policy supported by mr howard is one that we would commend on the way to a full abandonment of abortion . cardinal o connor claimed labour had developed the notion that it was the natural party of catholics but he said : we are not going to suggest people support one particular party . the family planning association says a reduction would particularly affect young women who often seek help later . more than 180 000 women in england and wales had terminations last year of which fewer than 1 % were carried out between 22 and 24 weeks . in the cosmopolitan interview mr howard said : i believe abortion should be available to everyone but the law should be changed . in the past i voted for a restriction to 22 weeks and i would be prepared to go down to 20. all three main parties say the issue is one for each mp s conscience rather than one where there is a party-wide policy . mr howard stressed his views were his personal views . shadow home secretary david davis said he understood mr howard had been signalling that a conservative government would allow a commons vote on the issue . mr blair and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy also gave their views during interviews conducted as part of the magazine s high heeled vote campaign . mr blair who last year denied he planned to join his wife and four children in the catholic faith despite regularly taking communion said abortion was a difficult issue . however much i dislike the idea of abortion you should not criminalise a woman who in very difficult circumstances makes that choice . obviously there is a time beyond which you can t have an abortion and we have no plans to change that although the debate will continue . mr kennedy said he had previously voted for a 22-week limit but medical advances mean i don t know what i would do now . the roman catholic archbishop of cardiff the most reverend peter smith told bbc radio 4 s today programme that the church merely wanted people to reflect on issues in light of the gospel before voting . anne weyman chief executive of the family planning association asked : what is the benefit to women or to the potential child of forcing a woman to have a baby anti-abortion group the pro-life alliance congratulated mr howard on his new stance but said it did not go far enough .', 'more movies head to sony s psp movies open water and saw

include a domain for pornography asia mobile phones an anti-spam domain and one for the catalan language and culture . the .post domain is backed by the universal postal union that wants to use it as

offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online . it is backed by a new york-based trade group called the travel partnership . icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted . despite this initial approval icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service . at the same time icann is considering proposals for another eight domains . one that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a .xxx domain for pornographic websites . a similar proposal has been made many times in the past . but icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it . in 2000 icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success . three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero . others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic . in total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations . but domains that end in the .com

energy . that s when francis obikwelu came up and i took third because i didn t know he was there . i believe that s what put me in lane seven in the final and while i was in lane seven i couldn t feel anything in the race . i just felt like i was running all alone . i believe if i was in the middle of the race i would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me . greene was also
